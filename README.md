Stock Management website

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Assessment Project
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, create a one-page Stock Management website with the functionality listed below.

Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap e
Use whatever CSS framework you want.

Use a JavaScript framework like Angular, Vue, React or jQuery
Use plain JavaScript or a framework if you know how to use one.

Use 3rd party packages from NPM if needed.

The website should consist of 3 sections:

A section where you can add new stock.
A section where you can remove stock.
A section where the current stock levels and average prices of stock are displayed.



ADD STOCK SECTION:

Your stock system only has 3 products, PRODUCT1, PRODUCT2 and PRODUCT3. Your website user should be able to add stock items to your stock system for these three products.

Number of items added should vary, for instance at some point you could receive 20 items of PRODUCT1. And at another time 45 items of PRODUCT3.

Prices also vary. For instance, you could receive 10 items of PRODUCT2 with an item price of R56.89. And next week you could receive 50 items of PRODUCT2 for an item price of R46.89.

With the above in mind, build a section where your website user can add these items using this 'Add Stock' section. Use the image below as guidance.



REMOVE STOCK SECTION:

Your website user should be able to remove stock from your stock system by ‘selling’ items. To remove stock, we need to know what product we’re ‘selling’, how many items of the product we’re selling, and we need an email address of the customer who ‘bought’ the products.

There is a catch though, a customer can only buy products once. So, if you bought 7 items of PRODUCT1 with email address test@test.com, you cannot buy anything again with test@test.com. You should notify your website user if he/she attempts to buy something with an email address that was already used.

With the above in mind, build a section where your website user can remove items using this 'Remove Stock' section.



STOCK LEVELS and AVERAGE STOCK PRICE SECTION:

Every time stock gets added or removed from our system, the number of items we have in stock for a specific product will change. The average price of a specific product will also change, seeing as we’re adding products for different prices.

Our website user needs to know how many items we have in stock for each of our 3 products, and what the average price is for each of our 3 products. This information needs to update and get displayed after every ‘add’ or ‘remove’ transaction.

With the above in mind, build a section where your website will display the above to the website user.
